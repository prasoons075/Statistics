So in this scenario, one distribution is fixed and we know what it is, what it's properties are and we compare the other or unknown sample with it. If the unknown sample of dataset follow given distribution, we will have a scatter plot, where data points will be in a straight line y = x.\n\nThe data points are quantile values of each distribution. The idea is to plot the quantile  values of two distributions/samples and see, if they make a straight line or not. If the quantiles of two sample sets are similar or in a better case, identical then sample set is from the same distribution. In better words, **if the distributions are identical, then the quantiles should be approximately equal.**\n\nDo note, that the known distribution need not to be only Normal Distribution, it can be any known distribution like, Exponential Distribution, Weibull Distribution, Binomial Distribution etc.\n\n\nLet's have some python code, to understand it better.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# A standard normal distribution, which means mean = 0, and stddev = 1\nrvs = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Generate or take out a sample of points from Normal Disb.\nnormal_sample = rvs.rvs(size=100000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# We can plot also, to see whether the values are indeed taken from normal distribution\nsns.set()\nsns.distplot(normal_sample)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see it totally looks like the cute bell curve everyone talks about. :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's plot Q-Q plot for these data points against the normal distribution.
